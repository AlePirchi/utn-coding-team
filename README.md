## Requirements

For this project we will be using a set of software that will be required for the proper team work:
- Skype - For meetings
    - SuperTintin for Skype  (Just in case you are the host)
- Browser - For developing, debugging and deploying
- Github App - For source control


### Skype
Install skype for your platform, you can find a direct link **[here](https://www.skype.com/es/download-skype/skype-for-computer/)**

### Browser
Any modern browser will do, but make sure that all the pages mentioned here are compatible with your browser version and that you have all the plugins, if any needed, installed.

### Github App
For this project we aren't using any IDE so Github plugins are not necesarry, although, if you want to use any you are free to do so. We encourage you to use the offial app, which can be downloaded **[here](https://desktop.github.com/)**

## Setup

### Meetings
The meeting objective is to provided both talking and sharing screen posibilities for the team and the ability to interact with each other. In addition to this the software "SuperTintin for Skype" is used to record the whole meeting, allowing all the members to watch the recording once it's uploaded to the repository.

Every **Friday** night we will have an skype meeting at **20:00 (UTC -3)** on skype, anyone can join this meeting by entering in this [link](http://bit.do/UTNTraining). Even if there is no one connected at the time you join the meeting, we suggest you to wait just in case someone is delayed. The link is dynamically so don't try to join more than an hour before the sheduled time.

### IDE
The list below is the one for the possible IDEs for this project, at the moment there is none choosen as the standard. If you want to add any other, do it through issues.

1. [Cloud 9](https://c9.io)
2. [Collabedit](http://collabedit.com/)
3. [Kobra](https://kobra.io)
4. [Codeshare](https://codeshare.io)

13. [CodingGround](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm)
14. [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com)

Further evaluation is due and the aspects to be evaluated are:
- Colaborative editting (Several people editing the same file online)
- Share Link
- Storage (All the files are stored in the cloud)
- Project-Like (You can manage different files and folders)
- Theme (Ergonomic theme for long-time training and Can ajust the size of the Fonts)
- Debbuging (Builtin debbuger)
- No Registrarion (No registration is needed)
- Multiple Languages
- Console
- Run on same window (The possibility to run the code without changing the page (not reloading))
- Github Integration
- Keybinding (Vim, Emacs, Sublime keybindings support)
- Chat (Builtin chat )

[ELC](https://github.com/ELC) Made a quick comparison with these IDEs, you can read it [here](IDEComparison.md)

If you want to know why we are using Online IDEs, check the [FAQ](#faq).

### SVC
The source version control for this repository is git and the platform we are going to use is GitHub. The repository should be forked by everymember and once an excercise is correctly resolved, a pull request should be fired.

## Directory Tree
The structure of the directory tree for this project will be like the following:
```
Root + PlatformName + ExcerciseCode + Username
```

For example:
```
/Spoj/1/skielcast
```

In this way each user will have their own folder for the exercises they have done and allow other users to check their solutions against their partners

For a quick view of the whole directory tree, you can check the badge at the top

- [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tutorialslibrary.htm)
- [C Plus Plus](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
- [C Programming](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial.html)

## TODOs
This is a list of the future features:
- Automatic documentation (specially with Doxygen)
- Recorded sessions directory
- Email list of all the members
- Newsletter email for improving communication
- Own Website (Github Pages)

## FAQ

### Why C++?
C++ is the standard in competitive programming, since it's used in most online judges and in programming competitions. Also it has a huge standard library and can run fast compared to other languages

### Why GitHub?
Github is easy to learn and provide useful integrations with a wide variety of servicies, specially SaaS, and because some of the members of the team might be new or novices, it's quite reasonable to use an user-friendly platform with little complexity

### Why Online IDEs?
Online IDEs allow us to work without installing nor downloading anything and reduce the time spend on the setup as much as possible. Versatility and eficiency are the main advantages of this way of working, just internet connection is needed for the training. Also, low-specs PCs can be used and we deppend on nothing more than the browser, Skype and Github, with everything being host on the cloud

## Aditional Resourses
This list shows IDEs, Debuggers, Frameworks and online resourses some members used in adition to what was explained in this README
* [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) - SaaS for editing and publishing Markdown files on GitHub
* [Veniversum](http://veniversum.me/) - SaaS for displaying the directory tree, used as a badge in the README
