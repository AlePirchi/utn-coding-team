## Disqualified
The following IDEs weren't included in the list for several reasons:
* [Cloud 9](https://c9.io) Needs credit card to sing up
* [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com) Too complex for our scenario - You can't run and compile individual files - Uses workstations
* [Nitrous](https://www.nitrous.io) It has total amount of hours limitations -  Uses workstations
* [Codepad](https://codepad.co) Too basic - Just store code as text with syntax
* [Codetasty](https://codetasty.com) Too complex for our scenario - You can't run and compile individual files - Uses workstations
* [Codenvy](https://codenvy.io) Too complex for our scenario - You can't run and compile individual files - Uses workstations
* [Koding](https://koding.com) Too complex for our scenario - Uses stacks arquitechture - Uses workstations
* [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com) Has no editor, doesn't fill our requirements

    - [CodingGround](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm)
    - [Repl](https://repl.it/)
- **Colaborative editting** and **Chat**:
    - [Collabedit](http://collabedit.com/)
    - [Kobra](https://kobra.io)
    - [Codeshare](https://codeshare.io)
- **No registration**:
    - [Collabedit](http://collabedit.com/)
    - [Kobra](https://kobra.io)
    - [Ideone](https://ideone.com/)
    - [Repl](https://repl.it/)
    - [CodingGround](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm)
- **Theme**:

    - [Codeshare](https://codeshare.io)
- **Storage**:
    - [Kobra](https://kobra.io)
    - [Ideone](https://ideone.com/)
    - [Repl](https://repl.it/)
    - [CodingGround](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm) 
- **Keybinding**:

    - [Repl](https://repl.it/)

## Conclusion
From my perspective I believe that the best choice is to combine the colaborative features of [Kobra](https://kobra.io) with the Console and Record from [Repl](https://repl.it/). Both having a dark theme, storage, keybindings and no registration is required.
